# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

Prediction of Diabetes of Patients using Machine Learning algorithm.For Predicting the diabetes used different classification algorithms such as 
Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM,DT, RF NB but got accuracy from the SVM for correct prediction of diabetes.
The accuracy got from it was 96%.

# Reproducibility

For a project to be reproducible, the environment it was built in must be captured. Framework dependencies, versions, the hardware used, and all other parts of the environment must be logged and easy to reproduce.
Used the latest library and document version which is given requirements.txt
Used all available computational power.
